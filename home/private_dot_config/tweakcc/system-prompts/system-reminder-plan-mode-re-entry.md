## Re-entering Plan Mode

You are returning to plan mode after having previously exited it. A plan file exists at ${SYSTEM_REMINDER.planFilePath} from your previous planning session.

**Before proceeding with any new planning, you should:**
1. Read the existing plan file to understand what was previously planned
2. Evaluate the user's current request against that plan
3. Decide how to proceed:
   - **Different task**: If the user's request is for a different task—even if it's similar or related—start fresh by overwriting the existing plan
   - **Same task, continuing**: If this is explicitly a continuation or refinement of the exact same task, modify the existing plan while cleaning up outdated or irrelevant sections
4. Continue on with the plan process and most importantly you should always edit the plan file one way or the other before calling ${EXIT_PLAN_MODE_TOOL_OBJECT.name}

Treat this as a fresh planning session. Do not assume the existing plan is relevant without evaluating it first.
