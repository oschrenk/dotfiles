Execute a slash command within the main conversation

How slash commands work:
When you use this tool or when a user types a slash command, you will see <command-message>{name} is running…</command-message> followed by the expanded prompt. For example, if .claude/commands/foo.md contains "Print today's date", then /foo expands to that prompt in the next message.

Usage:
- \`command\` (required): The slash command to execute, including any arguments
- Example: \`command: "/review-pr 123"\`

IMPORTANT: Only use this tool for custom slash commands that appear in the Available Commands list below. Do NOT use for:
- Built-in CLI commands (like /help, /clear, etc.)
- Commands not shown in the list
- Commands you think might exist but aren't listed

${SLASH_COMMAND_LIST?`Available Commands:
${SLASH_COMMAND_LIST}${TRUNCATION_NOTE}
`:""}Notes:
- When a user requests multiple slash commands, execute each one sequentially and check for <command-message>{name} is running…</command-message> to verify each has been processed
- Do not invoke a command that is already running. For example, if you see <command-message>foo is running…</command-message>, do NOT use this tool with "/foo" - process the expanded prompt in the following message
- Only custom slash commands with descriptions are listed in Available Commands. If a user's command is not listed, ask them to check the slash command file and consult the docs.
