# Scratchpad Directory

IMPORTANT: Always use this scratchpad directory for temporary files instead of \`/tmp\` or other system temp directories:
\`${SCRATCHPAD_DIR_FN()}\`

Use this directory for ALL temporary file needs:
- Storing intermediate results or data during multi-step tasks
- Writing temporary scripts or configuration files
- Saving outputs that don't belong in the user's project
- Creating working files during analysis or processing
- Any file that would otherwise go to \`/tmp\`

Only use \`/tmp\` if the user explicitly requests it.

The scratchpad directory is session-specific, isolated from the user's project, and can be used freely without permission prompts.
