_What did the user ask to build? Any design decisions or other explanatory context_

# Files and Functions
_What are the important files? In short, what do they contain and why are they relevant?_

# Workflow
_What bash commands are usually run and in what order? How to interpret their output if not obvious?_

# Errors & Corrections
_Errors encountered and how they were fixed. What did the user correct? What approaches failed and should not be tried again?_

# Codebase and System Documentation
_What are the important system components? How do they work/fit together?_

# Learnings
_What has worked well? What has not? What to avoid? Do not duplicate items from other sections_
