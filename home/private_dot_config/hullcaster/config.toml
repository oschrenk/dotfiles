# Hullcaster settings
# --------------------

# Specifies where podcast episodes that are downloaded will be stored.
# Defaults:
# $XDG_DATA_HOME/hullcaster/ or $HOME/.local/share/hullcaster/ on Linux
# $HOME/Library/Application Support/hullcaster/ on Mac
# C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Local\hullcaster\ on Windows

#download_path = "~/.local/share/hullcaster/"


# Command to use to play episodes. Use "%s" to indicate where file/URL
# will be entered to the command.
# Default: vlc %s

#play_command = "vlc %s"


# Configures what happens when new episodes are found as podcasts are
# synced:
#  - "always" will automatically download all new episodes;
#  - "ask-selected" will open a popup window to let you select which
#    episodes to download, with all of them selected by default;
#  - "ask-unselected" will open a popup window to let you select which
#    episodes to download, with NONE of them selected by default;
#  - "never" will never automatically download new episodes.
# Default: "ask-unselected"

#download_new_episodes = "ask-unselected"


# Maximum number of files to download simultaneously. Setting this too
# high could result in network requests being denied. A good general
# guide would be to set this to the number of processor cores on your
# computer.
# Default: 3

#simultaneous_downloads = 3


# Maximum number of times to retry connecting to a URL to sync a
# podcast or download an episode.
# Default: 3

#max_retries = 3

# Mark episode as played automatically.
# Default: true

# mark_as_played_on_play = true


# Enable synchronization with a gpodder server
# Default: false

# enable_sync = false


# Address of the gpodder server
# Default: None

# sync_server = "https://gpodder.myserver.dev"


# Gpodder server username
# Default: None
# Required when enable_sync = true

# sync_username = "myusername"


# Gpodder server password
# Default: None
# Required when enable_sync = true and sync_password_eval is None

# sync_password = "mypassword"


# Gpodder server password eval
# Default: None
# Required when enable_sync = true and sync_password is None

# sync_password_eval = "pass gpodder"


# Sync on start, podcasts and gpodder
# Default: True

# sync_on_start = true

[keybindings]

# Keybindings must be an array of one or more strings.
# If you want to distinguish between a regular alphanumeric key
# and Shift+key, you can use the capital letter that you would normally
# type when pressing Shift+key (e.g., Shift+"r" will give you "R").

# Other special characters and their config string:
# Arrow keys: "Left", "Right", "Up", "Down"
# Ctrl+key: "C-key" (e.g., "C-r" means Ctrl+"r")
# Shift+key: "S-key" (e.g., "S-Del" means Shift+Delete)
# Insert ("Ins"), Delete ("Del"), Home ("Home"), End ("End"),
# Page up ("PgUp"), Page down ("PgDn"), Tab ("Tab")
# Enter ("Enter"), Escape ("Esc") -- be aware that on some terminals the
# Escape key waits for further input before passing it along to
# hullcaster, so you might notice a delay with this key

# Don't try to use backslash, or you're gonna have a bad time

[colors]

# Colors can be identified in three ways:
# 1. Using color names defined by your terminal:
#    - black, darkgrey, red, darkred, green, darkgreen, yellow,
#      darkyellow, blue, darkblue, magenta, darkmagenta, cyan,
#      darkcyan, white, or grey
#    - The special color name "terminal" can also be used to specify
#      your terminal's default foreground or background color; this is
#      particularly useful if your terminal background is transparent --
#      use "terminal" for the background colors below.
# 2. Using a hex code in the format "#ff0000" or "#FF0000" to specify
#    RGB values.
# 3. Using an RGB value in the format "rgb(255, 0, 0)" where each number
#    is a value between 0 and 255.
# Note that, as might be expected, the ability to set colors depends on
# the capabilities of your terminal. Config options set below are ignored
# on terminals without the ability to add/change colors.

# all regular text
