Also provides focus toggling between splitview \"halves\".\nImportant points:\n* `SplitView` Relies on the undocumented `spaces` API, which _must_ be installed separately for it to work; see https:\/\/github.com\/asmagill\/hs._asm.undocumented.spaces\n* This tool works by _simulating_ the split-view user interface: a long green-button click followed by a 2nd window click.  This requires hand tuned time delays to work reliably.  If it is unreliable for you, trying increasing these (see `delay*` variables, below).\n* `SplitView` uses `hw.window.filter` to try to ignore atypical windows (menu panes, etc.), which see.  Unrecognized non-standard windows may interfere with `SplitView`'s operation.\n* If there is only a single space, `SplitView` creates _and does not remove_ a new, empty space for temporarily holding unwanted windows from the same application(s).  This space can safely be deleted, but will recur on future invocations.\nDownload: [https:\/\/github.com\/Hammerspoon\/Spoons\/raw\/master\/Spoons\/SplitView.spoon.zip]\nExample config in you `~\/.hammerspoon\/init.lua`:\n```\nmash =      {\"ctrl\", \"cmd\"}\nspoon.splitView=hs.loadSpoon(\"SplitView\")\nspoon.splitView:bindHotkeys({choose={mash,\"s\"},switchFocus={mash,\"x\"},chooseAppEmacs={mash,\"e\",\"Emacs\"})\n```",
