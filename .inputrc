# History
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# By default up/down are bound to previous-history
# and next-history respectively. The following does the
# same but gives the extra functionality where if you
# type any text (or more accurately, if there is any text
# between the start of the line and the cursor),
# the subset of the history starting with that text
# is searched (like 4dos for e.g.).
# Note to get rid of a line just Ctrl-C
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward

# Remember the cursor position for each history line. Note that this only works
# for previous-history and next-history, and apparently not (or not so well)
# with my Up/Down key bindings history-search-{back,for}ward.
set history-preserve-point on

# Autocompletion
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# If set to `on', Readline performs filename matching and completion in a 
# case-insensitive fashion. The default value is `off'. 
# Make Tab autocompletion case-insensitive (cd ~/dow<Tab> => cd ~/Downloads/).
set completion-ignore-case On

# If set to `on', and completion-ignore-case is enabled, 
# Readline treats hyphens (`-') and underscores (`_') as equivalent 
# when performing case-insensitive filename matching and completion.
set completion-map-case on

# When autocompleting symlinks to directories, immediately add a trailing "/".
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# Flip through autocompletion matches with Shift-Tab.
"\e[Z": menu-complete

# Do not autocomplete hidden files ("dot files") unless the pattern explicitly
# begins with a dot.
set match-hidden-files off

# Show all autocomplete results at once.
set page-completions off

# If there are more than 200 possible completions for a word, ask to show them
# all.
set completion-query-items 200

# Immediately show all possible completions.
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# Show extra file information when completing, like ls -F does.
set visible-stats on

# Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
# the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
# the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
# ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)
set skip-completed-text on

# Line editing
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Use Ctrl+← and Ctrl+→ (or Alt/Meta, or Esc) to move between words.
