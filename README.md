# README

These are my dotfiles. There are many like it but these are mine.

## Install new machine

Name your machine
> On your Mac, choose "System Settings", "General"  in the sidebar, click "About" on the right.
> Type a new name in the Name field.

> On your Mac the local hostname is the computerâ€™s name with `.local` added, and any spaces are replaced with hyphens

Check chezmois idea of the hostname via:
```
chezmoi execute-template '{{ .chezmoi.hostname }}'
```

Install homebrew and bootstrap requirements

```
# install homebrew
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
# temporary setup path in zsh until we have fish
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

# install chezmoi and requirements
brew install chezmoi git git-lfs age 1password 1password-cli
git lfs install
```

Setup 1Password and sync the vaults.

Initialize chezmoi.

```
chezmoi init oschrenk/dotfiles
```

Certain files require age decryption. You will be asked a few questions.
These answers are stored in 1Password under "Chezmoi / Age / Key"

```
Age identity file location?
Age public key?
```

Pull binary assets

```
chezmoi cd
git lfs pull
```

Apply

```
chezmoi apply
```
