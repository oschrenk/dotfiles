# README #

These are my dotfiles. There are many like it but these are mine.

I manage the dotfiles with [node-deja](https://github.com/mcantelon/node-deja) and recommend to do the same or at least to use [homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) which is written in Ruby and was the inspiration for `node-deja`.

Inspired by many other dotfiles:

- [mathiasbynens / dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)
- [janmoesen / tilde](https://github.com/janmoesen/tilde)
- [holman / dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)
